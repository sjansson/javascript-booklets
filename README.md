# Javascript-bookmarklets [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

A collection of javascript scripts that can aid in testing or with repetitive tasks on a website.

## History

As a Continuous QA Engineer with high interest in automation, I don't just want to automate checks in our pipelines or develop monitoring systems. 
I also want automation to be an empowering force in exploratory testing.

In web testing many tasks gets repetitive when testing E2E where we don't want to skip or mock things. I've found that custom created javascript-bookmarklets are a great way to plow through boring, repetitive and time-consuming parts. 

Like for example..
- click buttons/elements
- choosing options in dropdowns
- filling in data in a form and submit it
- opening 6 new tabs with 6 specified urls
- opening a specified url in six new windows with different resolutions

I constantly seek ways to improve quality and the efficiency in minimum time, effort, friction and stress on the team in achieving high quality and frequently releasing products.

Javascript bookmarklets is just one little piece in that puzzle.
