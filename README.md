A collection of javascript scripts that can aid in testing or with repetitive tasks on a website.

## History

As a Continuous QA Engineer with high interest of automation, I don't just want to automate checks in our pipelines or develop our monitoring systems further. I also want automation to be an empowering force in exploratory testing.

In web testing many tasks gets repetitive when testing E2E where we don't want to skip or mock things. I've found that custom created javascript-booklets are a great way to plow through boring, repetitive and time-consuming parts. Like filling in a forms, choosing options in dropdowns and clicking buttons.

I constantly seek ways to improve quality and the efficiency in minimum time, effort, friction and stress on the team in achieving high quality and frequently releasing products.

Javascript booklets is just one little piece in that puzzle.
